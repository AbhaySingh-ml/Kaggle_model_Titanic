# 🛳️ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is part of the **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition. It aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and more. It is one of the most popular beginner-friendly projects for understanding data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification models.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Contains data for passengers on the Titanic
- Key features:
  - `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
  - `Sex`: Gender
  - `Age`: Age in years
  - `SibSp`, `Parch`: Family aboard
  - `Fare`: Passenger fare
  - `Embarked`: Port of embarkation

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> Predict whether a given passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on attributes like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

---

## 🔧 Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized survival distribution by gender, class, age group
   - Analyzed feature importance and correlation

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features (e.g., `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`)
   - Converted categorical features using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding

4. **Model Building**
   - Tried multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV (if used)

5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation

## 📊 Results

- Best model: **Random Forest Classifier** (example)
- Accuracy on validation set: **~78%** (replace with your actual score)
- Submitted predictions to Kaggle for public leaderboard scoring

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements

- Try ensemble models like XGBoost or LightGBM
- Perform more advanced hyperparameter tuning
- Use feature selection techniques
- Visualize feature importance in more depth
